# Label Strategies for BART Testing
# Format: [Strategy Name]
# filter_name | label1, label2, label3 | threshold | reject_index
#
# reject_index: which label indicates rejection (0=first label, 1=second label, etc.)
# threshold: score above this value for reject_index = REJECT
#
# Example: Factual | factual, personal | 0.6 | 1
# This means: if "personal" score > 0.6, REJECT the claim
